# R_diagnostics
A template for simple diagnostics in R which requires no libraries. For error checking, tracking and accountability.
Directories are recorded, ensuring the correct files have been used.
The time and date of the codeâ€™s execution to differentiate between runs.
Time to run and ram usage are noted largely for optimisation purposes in development but may also be an indicator of a failure.
Any warnings Rstudio printed are recorded, as the clearest way of identifying issues.
Finally, the R version and system OS version are saved as it may help with future diagnosis of errors.
